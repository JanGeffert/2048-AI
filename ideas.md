# Ideas
* Make test board instances to see how our algorithm makes a decision in different cases

# Agents
* Greedy agents with different heuristics
* * H

# Metrics
* Highest Tile Reached
* Total Score at EndGame
* Distribution of Moves Made
* Average number of empty squares
* Distribution of relative location of max tile on board
* Monotonicity - how close together tile values are
* Number of merges per move on average
